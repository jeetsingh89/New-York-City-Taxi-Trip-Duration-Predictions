# New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Predictions
I will try and analyse the dataset and try to create Machine Learning models that will predict the taxi trip duration.
The objectives for this notebook are :

Understanding and defining the input and target columns.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
Splitting the dataset into training, validation and test sets.
Try and fit different machine learning models to the data and find out the best model.
Hyperparameter tuning
Feature Engineering
Making Predictions on the test set.
